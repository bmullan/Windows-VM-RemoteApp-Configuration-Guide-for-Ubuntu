# Create an LXD Windows VM and Configure it to run  
# Windows applications as RemoteApps on your Ubuntu
# Desktop in their own individual Gnome Windows

The Configuration Guide PDF provided in this Repository includes all the steps required to:

* create an LXD Windows VM (you must use one of your valid Windows licenses)
* configure your Windows UserID as a RemoteAPP user
* install/configure Kim Knight's RemoteAppTool so it enables the RemoteApp functionality
* install/configure xfreerdp on your Ubuntu Host so you can start RemoteApps from your Ubuntu system

Each Windows application that you later run will execute in its own Gnome Window just like any other
Ubuntu Application.

You can move, resize, maximize, minimize the Windows Application window.

The example xfreerdp command line:
* configures a "shared-folder" that you can exchange/share files between your Windows VM and your Ubuntu Host.
* Enables Sound from your Window applications to play through your Ubuntu Host's speakers

Please review the Windows VM RemoteApp Configuration Guide PDF for all of the installation/configuration steps
required.
